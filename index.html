          <h1>How it works</h1>
          <p>
            “Feat-Tac-Toe” is a homebrew option that enables players to unlock additional feats by completing a set of
            challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each feat, players are given a 3x3 grid of in-game challenges their character may satisfy. If a player
            can complete 3-in-a-row, then they permanently unlock that feat for their player character.
          </p>
          <p>No double dipping! A challenge only counts for <em>one</em> feat-tac-toe board at a time.</p>
          <h1>Is this balanced?</h1>
          <p>Probably not.</p>
          <h1>What are Lite feats?</h1>
          <p>
            Lite feats are modified to reduce overall power level. Some feats are arguably too strong to be unlockable
            in their base forms.
          </p>
          <p>For example, stacking feats that grant +1s to ability scores could easily get out of hand.</p>
          <h1>Can I make my own?</h1>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
